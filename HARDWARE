## Estimated Cost (to buy)

| Category | Est. Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| SG90 2-pack (spares) | ~$8 |
| Pico W | ~$6 |
| Pi Zero 2W | ~$15 |
| Sensors (IMU, ToF, current) | ~$20-25 |
| Pi Zero camera cable | ~$6 |
| Screws/Hardware | ~$10-15 |
| Servo Extensions | ~$10 |
| **Total to Buy** | **~$75-85** |

## Notes
- Battery: Use existing Titan 3.5Ah - it's on the heavier side but should work
- Power: Turnigy PLUSH 60A ESC has 3A 5V BEC built-in, no separate BEC needed
- Servos: Mix SG90 (light joints) with HS-82MG (high-torque joints like femur)
- Camera: v1.3 works but needs Pi Zero camera cable (different connector)
- VL53L0X sensors need XSHUT pins wired to set different I2C addresses
